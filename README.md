## tictactoe-for-terminal
Tic-tac-toe is a classic game in which two players ("X" and "O"), in alternating rounds, select a space to place their symbol, to complete a sequence of 3 adjacent spaces or block their opponent from doing so. Based on this, I created the code to replicate this game on the terminal.
## How to play:
First you need to select the symbol. The first player seletcs and the second player stays with the symbol remaining.
